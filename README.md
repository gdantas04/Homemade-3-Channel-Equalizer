# 3-Channel DIY Audio Equalizer 🎚️

This is a personal project: a fully DIY analog audio equalizer with three adjustable bands — bass, mid, and treble. The main goal was to design a simple yet effective tool for real-time frequency control, using analog circuitry.

## ✨ Project Highlights

* ✅ Designed entirely from scratch — no kits or ready-made modules
* 🎛️ Three-band equalization: Low, Mid, High
* 🔧 Pure analog circuitry with op-amps and passive components
* 🎧 Suitable for hobbyists, students, and audio tinkerers
* 🎥 Demo video available

## 🌍 Community Recognition

This project unexpectedly gained traction in an Electrical Engineering community on Reddit. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with technical discussions and supportive feedback.

Among those who saw the project was the founder of **Electroagenda**, a well-known European electronics portal. He reached out and invited me to write a featured article explaining the design process and technical details of the equalizer.
